# Attack Container

This container is run on the bastion host.  When you SSH onto the bastion using
`simulator ssh attack` you will land in here.  It comes with the set of tools
needed to complete a scenario.  

The container will also provide instructions for a scenario after the cluster
has been perturbed and it will provide a `start` script to get the user to the
point for the scenario as well as helper scripts to navigate around the cluster.
