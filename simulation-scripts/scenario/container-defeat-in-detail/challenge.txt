One of your engineers has noticed that there are more pods of your node-cert-manager DaemonSet running than they would expect. There is a known vulnerability in the node-cert-manager pod (so start this task by exec'ing into one of them in the container-defeat-in-detail namespace), can you demonstrate the extra pods are a significant concern by retrieving a flag from etcd (etcd is running at $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES )?

The node-cert-manager should only be running on the workers, what can you do to fix its scheduling. Note: The DaemonSet itself should not be edited for this task.
