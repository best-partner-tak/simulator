Scenario: One of your engineers has noticed that there are more pods of your node-cert-manager DaemonSet running than they would expect.
There is a known vulnerability in the node-cert-manager pod.

Starting Point: cert-manager pod in the container-defeat-in-detail namespace.

Difficulty: Meduim

Task 1: Can you demonstrate that the extra pods are a significant concern by retrieving a flag from etcd?
Details: etcd is running at $MASTER_IP_ADDRESSES.

Task 2: The node-cert-manager should only be running on the workers, what can you do to fix its scheduling?
Details: The DaemonSet itself should not be edited for this task.
