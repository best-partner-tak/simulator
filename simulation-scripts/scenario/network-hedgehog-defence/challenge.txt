You are performing a postmortem on an attack against your database in the network-hedgehog-defence namespace.
The database service is only supposed to be reachable from within its namespace, but your audit logs have revealed
unusual requests from an unrelated setup pod in the default namespace. Figure out how the setup pod has managed to send
postgres requests from a different namespace.

Having succeeded, which Kubernetes resource can you add to the namespace to prevent this communication,
but still allow the frontend to communicate with the database? Please implement your solution.
