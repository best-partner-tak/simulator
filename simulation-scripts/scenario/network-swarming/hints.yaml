    hint-1: "I wonder what the services for the 'database' and 'api' are called? I think the names might be obvious."
    hint-2: "I don't the api will be useful, can I look at the datbase from here?"
    hint-3: "Many databases are sql based, could it be one of the popular ones?"
    hint-4: "I wonder what the default username for the sql database is?"
    hint-5: "One of the devs mentioned a postgres database they used didn't have a password, could this be it?"

    hint-8: "task 2 - I wonder if a network policy would help here"
