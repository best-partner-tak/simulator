    hint-1: "Task 1: I wonder what the services for the 'database' and 'api' are called? I think the names might be obvious."
    hint-2: "Task 1: I don't think the API will be useful, can I look at the database from here?"
    hint-3: "Task 1: Many databases are SQL based, could it be one of the popular ones?"
    hint-4: "Task 1: I wonder what the default username for the database is."
    hint-5: "Task 1: One of the devs mentioned a Postgres database they used didn't have a password, could this be it?"

    hint-7: "Task 2: The database shouldn't be talking to the frontend."
