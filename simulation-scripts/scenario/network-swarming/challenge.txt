You are performing a postmortem on an attack against your infrastructure. Your application in this namespace (network-swarming) follows a standard frontend --> api --> database request flow. During the attack it was obvious that your frontend pods were compromised (please 'kubectl exec' into them to start this exercise). However, it appears as though your api pods were untouched and they did not respond to any unusual requests. Unfortunately, the database logs reported some odd activity during the attack. Concerns over a potential database compromise have been dismissed as "contacting the database from the frontend would violate our request flow".
Regardless, can you replay the attack and explain the unusual database logs?

Having succeeded, which Kubernetes resource can you add to the namespace to prevent this happening again? Please implement your solution.
