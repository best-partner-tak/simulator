Scenario: You have been asked to perform a security test on an application hosted in Kubernetes.
To make the test as close to reality as possible you have only been told that the application is exposed as a NodePort service on IP address "$MASTER_IP_ADDRESS".
The application is the only app deployed to this cluster and does not need to access the Kubernetes control plane at run time.

Starting Point:

Task 1: How can you update the cluster configuration to mitigate this finding?
