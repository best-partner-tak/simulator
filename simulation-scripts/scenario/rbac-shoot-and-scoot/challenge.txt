Scenario: A developer has informed you, they are able to make Kubernetes API calls from an Ubuntu pod to get a secret although its service account token is unmounted.

Starting Point: ubuntu pod in the rbac-shoot-and-scoot namespace

Difficulty: Easy

Task 1: Can you replicate this issue by finding the value of the credentials secret in the rbac-shoot-and-scoot namespace?

Task 2: Figure out the reason behind this and reset the cluster to benchmark recommendations.
