Scenario: A developer has informed you that the ubuntu deployment is able to make secret calls to the API server. Only the secrets-caller pod should be able to do that.

Task 1: Can you replicate this issue.

Task 2: Figure out the reason behind this and reset the cluster to benchmark recommendations.
