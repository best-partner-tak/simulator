      - text: Can I run or install kubectl in here?

          Hmm, I can't see secrets directly. I wonder what the deployment of the
          application pods looks like?

          Is there a rolebinding or clusterrolebinding bound to the default
          service account in this namespace?
      - text: >-
          Looks like there is not a direct binding to the serviceice account.
          Using the pods token we are in the system:authenticated group. Is
          something bound to that?
      - text: >-
          Looks like the authenticated-view ClusterRoleBinding is giving the
          group more permissions! It should probably be deleted for now.

    hints:
      - text: The pod should not mount the default service token.
      - text: >-
          The application pods already do this maybe I could look there for
          inspiration.
