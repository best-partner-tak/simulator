Welcome to the database compromise challenge!

To Start:
1. ssh -i <path to private key> root@<master host>

2. Get the name of the jenkins pod in the data namespace:
kubectl get po -n data

3. Exec into it
kubectl exec -ti <pod name> bash -c jenkins -n data

Your cake decorating business is failing, and it's certainly due to a rival competitor. You have managed to find your way into their proxy container. Gain access to their database, to wreck havoc in their stock repetoire. (get the password)

For the purpose of the exercise, pretend that you have breached your way into jenkins (without the use of kubectl).
- You may not `exit` the container or return to the host
- You may not use `kubectl`
