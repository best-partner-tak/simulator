Scenario: During a security audit you have noticed an unpatched vulnerability in a CI build agent in your build farm.
This could potentially lead to the expose of sensitive data in the attached databases.

Starting Point:

Task 1: Demonstrate whether it is possible to retrieve sensitive data from any of the databases.
Task 2: Change the postgres deployment so the secret password isn't so easily accessible and is consumed in the secure way.
