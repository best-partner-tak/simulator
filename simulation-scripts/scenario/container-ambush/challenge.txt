Scenario: During a security audit you have noticed an unpatched vulnerability in a CI build agent in your build farm.  This
could potentially lead to the expose of sensitive data in the attached databases.

Starting Point:

Task 1: Demonstrate whether it is possible to retrieve sensitive data from any of the databases.

Task 2: Update the deployment to prevent this issue from occurring.
