    hints:
    - text: Have you looked into the the kubelet?
    - text: The kubelet read-write API sits on port 10250. You may need to install
        some tools to get the information you need.
    - text: Get the pod information from one of the nodes until you hit a good pod;
        curl -k https://<node-IP>:10250/pods What can you do with this information?
    - text: From the pod information you saw that there are some secrets mounted in
        the secret-pod. Can you run any commands in the pod?
    - text: Run the printenv command in the container you found; curl -k -XPOST "https://<node-ip>:10250/run/node-amphibious-operations/<pod
        name>/<container name>" -d "cmd=printenv" You will be able to find the pod
        and container name from the previous pods endpoint.

    summary: "We were able to query the kubelet api directly and get some sensitive data about the pods. We then took this further and used our access to run arbitrary commands inside the pod."

    hints:
    - text: You need to fix /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.
    - text: "'authentication.anonymous.enabled' value should be 'false' and 'authorization.mode'
        should be 'Webhook'."
    - text: "'systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl restart kubelet.service' applies
        the config changes."

    summary: "We edited the kubelet yaml to disable anonymous authentication and enforce the webhook authentication mode. We then restarted the kubelet."
